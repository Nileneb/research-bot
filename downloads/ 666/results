  <title>Becoming a Rapid Shooter in a Game Using Embodied Electrical Muscle Stimulation: Development and Usability Study.</title>
  <abstract>Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) systems enhance human capabilities, such as reaction time, by inducing preemptive muscle contractions. One of the key challenges for EMS applications is preserving the user's sense of agency, and it is defined as a subjective experience of initiating and controlling one's actions. Prior research highlights the importance of the "sweet spot"-a balance between sense of agency and preemptive gain-for effective EMS use. However, most prior studies have focused on simplistic tasks, leaving a gap in understanding how the sweet spot functions in complex and ecological game scenarios. Moreover, the potential benefits of a personalized approach were not explored.</abstract>
