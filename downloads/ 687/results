  <title>Determinants of the adoption of an online community for people with diabetes: a qualitative study.</title>
  <abstract>This study explores user experiences of CompARTE Diabetes, a nurse-moderated online peer support community, to identify factors influencing its adoption using the Non-adoption, Abandoning, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework. A qualitative descriptive design was employed through semi-structured interviews with 15 adult users (33.3% women; aged 19-65, M = 42.3) conducted between November and December 2024. Participants were purposively selected and met inclusion criteria. Data were thematically analysed using a deductive approach aligned with the NASSS, supported by inductive coding. Adoption was facilitated by a user-friendly interface, mobile app functionality, and attractive design. Nurse moderation was pivotal in fostering trust, curbing misinformation, and promoting meaningful discussion. Participants highlighted the value of innovative content, gamification, and hybrid (online/offline) interactions. Peer support reduced isolation, improved emotional well-being, and enhanced self-care. Barriers included technical difficulties, limited time, stigma, and challenges in integrating diabetes management into daily life. In conclusion, moderated virtual communities such as CompARTE Diabetes offer emotional, educational, and practical support for people with diabetes. Their success depends on overcoming digital divides, maintaining professional moderation, and fostering user engagement to enhance chronic illness self-management. Future studies should explore the long-term effects on clinical outcomes and assess strategies to enhance inclusivity across diverse populations.</abstract>
