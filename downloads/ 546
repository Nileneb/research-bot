<output>I have retrieved relevant academic papers on the topic of children with brain cancer undergoing radiotherapy, focusing on outcomes such as survival, prognosis, toxicity, quality of life, and neurocognitive effects. The search was performed across PubMed, Google Scholar, arXiv, and bioRxiv databases. Below is a summary of selected relevant papers from these sources:

PubMed:
1. Title: Dissecting the Impact of Genetic Background on Oncogenic Response to Radiation Exposure in the Medulloblastoma Model.
   URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39594660/
   Summary: Focuses on medulloblastoma, a primary pediatric brain cancer, and examines genetic factors influencing radiation response.

2. Title: Effects of dopamine receptor antagonists and radiation on mouse neural stem/progenitor cells.
   URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39341503/
   Summary: Investigates the combined effects of dopamine receptor antagonists and radiation on neural stem/progenitor cells, relevant for pediatric glioma radiotherapy.

3. Title: EDA2R reflects the acute brain response to cranial irradiation in liquid biopsies.
   URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38683135/
   Summary: Studies biomarkers in liquid biopsies predicting neurocognitive complications from cranial radiotherapy in children.

4. Title: Comparing the effects of irradiation with protons or photons on neonatal mouse brain.
   URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38614282/
   Summary: Compares proton vs photon radiation effects, including apoptosis and hippocampal alterations, relevant to pediatric treatment toxicity.

5. Title: Medulloblastoma: The latest major advances.
   URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36822958/
   Summary: Reviews recent advances in medulloblastoma research including treatment modalities and their outcomes.

Google Scholar:
- Papers include studies on modern radiotherapy for pediatric brain tumors, proton therapy outcomes, long-term quality of life after proton radiotherapy, and radiosensitization in pediatric ependymoma.

arXiv:
- Papers cover machine learning applications in pediatric brain tumor subtype classification, neural network modeling for tumor progression prediction after irradiation, and segmentation of pediatric brain tumors for therapy response monitoring.

bioRxiv:
- Papers here did not directly match the topic of pediatric brain cancer and radiotherapy but cover broader neuroscience and molecular biology themes.

If you want, I can provide more detailed summaries or retrieve full texts of any particular papers. Would you like me to focus on clinical studies, neurocognitive toxicity, quality-of-life outcomes, or treatment efficacy? Or retrieve full-text PDFs?</output>
