It now shapes how people learn, work, communicate, and manage health. For occupational therapy, which centers on enabling meaningful participation across contexts, this technological transformation presents critical challenges and opportunities. Despite AI's growing presence, the profession lacks cohesive standards or strategies to address its impact on education, clinical reasoning, or client-centered practice. AI is a practice-relevant and educationally urgent phenomenon that demands structured engagement and leadership within the profession to ensure its ethical, inclusive integration. Occupational therapy practitioners must be prepared to support students, practitioners, and clients in navigating these technologies. Without clear competencies and shared frameworks, the profession risks marginalization and missed opportunities to uphold occupational justice. Action is needed in three domains: (1) occupational therapy education, where AI literacy and ethical use must be taught and modeled; (2) clinical practice, where AI tools require critical evaluation and adaptation; and (3) client engagement, where AI use must be recognized and supported as an evolving occupation. Accreditation, continuing education, and public policy must align to support this shift.","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40990903/","doi":"10.5014/ajot.2025.051283","pmid":"40990903","arxiv_id":null,"year":2025,"journal":null,"authors":["Jozkowski, AC"],"categories":[],"published":"2025-01-01","primary_topic":"Health;Education;Artificial Intelligence","secondary_topics":["Occupational Therapy","Leadership Development"],"potential_impact":4},{"title":"From digital advancement to SDGs disruption: How artificial intelligence without inclusion threatens sustainable development in G7 economies.","abstract":"Sustainable development remains a critical priority under the United Nations 2030 Agenda, and the G7 economies-Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States-play a pivotal role due to their economic influence, technological leadership, and environmental responsibility. This study investigates the long-run determinants of sustainable development in the G7 from 1995 to 2022, using the Sustainable Development Index (SDG) as the dependent variable. Six explanatory factors are considered: artificial intelligence adoption (AI), women's entrepreneurship (FEM), technological intensity (TEC), global warming (SUR), income inequality (INI), and unemployment (UNM). The empirical strategy employs Fixed Effects estimation with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, validated through the Hausman test, and complemented with Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and Common Correlated Effects Mean Group (CCEMG) estimators for robustness against cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity. The results reveal that AI exhibits a negative association with the SDG index under the baseline model, underscoring the risks of digital transformation without inclusive policies, though AMG suggests a potential positive effect under heterogeneous country conditions. Women's entrepreneurship, while positively signed, is statistically insignificant, indicating persistent structural barriers in the G7. Technological intensity consistently demonstrates a positive and significant impact, highlighting the role of advanced industrial innovation in driving sustainability. Rising surface temperatures exert a weakly negative effect, reaffirming climate change as a threat to long-term development. Income inequality remains statistically insignificant but directionally adverse. Unemployment shows a strong and positive association across all estimators, reflecting structural labor market adjustments during the transition toward greener and more sustainable sectors. This study contributes to the literature by integrating digital, social, economic, and environmental dimensions within a robust econometric framework tailored for high-income economies. Policy recommendations emphasize inclusive digital transformation, stronger support for women-led enterprises, investment in clean technologies, proactive climate action, and labor market policies that align green transitions with social equity.","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40986962/","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.127411","pmid":"40986962","arxiv_id":null,"year":2025,"journal":null,"authors":["Mai, S","Qing, L","Mehmood, U","Almulhim, AA","Aljughaiman, AA"],"categories":[],"published":"2025-01-01","primary_topic":"Sustainability;Artificial Intelligence;Entrepreneurship","secondary_topics":["Women's Entrepreneurship","Economic Policy"],"potential_impact":4},{"title":"Shaping the Future of the Health Information Profession: The Impact of Emerging Technologies on the Workforce.","abstract":"In this commentary, the authors explore the transformative impact of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and electronic health record (EHR) optimization, on the field of health information (HI).

In this article, we describe an innovative Gain in Research Ability Test per Literature (GRATL) framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into experiential learning (EL) of obesity physiology and etiology through community outreach projects. The GRATL framework sets seven areas of research competencies, i.e., Identify, Question, Plan, Conduct, Analyze, Conclude, and Communicate, as the anticipated learning outcomes (ALOs), and it navigates the design and implementation of research and learning activities. The quantitative matrix of GRATL navigated AI application through rigorous verification and assessed the growth of students' research ability. Our data suggest that the GRATL framework enhanced students' discipline knowledge, research ability, and career competency skills including communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, knowledge construction with AI assistance, teamwork, leadership, and self-management. In addition, the students helped the communities gain a better understanding of obesity and appreciated the roles of lifestyle behaviors in chronic disease. As the seven areas of research competencies are valued and observed across disciplines, the GRATL framework coupled with AI-assisted EL may be adjustable and scalable in teaching and learning of other subjects.","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40712652/","doi":"10.1152/advan.00025.2025","pmid":"40712652","arxiv_id":null,"year":2025,"journal":null,"authors":["Cheng, Z","Yang, J","Shelnutt, KP"],"categories":[],"published":"2025-01-01","primary_topic":"Education;Healthcare;Artificial Intelligence","secondary_topics":["Experiential Learning","Leadership Development"],"potential_impact":4},{"title":"A descriptive phenomenological study of postgraduate nursing students' experiences with ChatGPT.","abstract":"Postgraduate education plays a critical role in preparing nurses for advanced practice and leadership roles.

The hybrid stacking approach did an excellent implementation using Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost as base learners with Gradient Boosting as a meta-learner, which managed to record an accuracy of 90%. That indeed puts into great perspective the huge potential it possesses for accuracy measures while predicting in educational setups. The CNN model, which predicted with an accuracy of 89%, showed quite impressive capability in sentiment analysis to acquire further insight into the emotional status of the students. RCNN, Random Forests, and Decision Trees contribute to the possibility of educational data complexity with valuable insight into the complex interrelationships within ML models and educational contexts. The application of the bagging XGBoost algorithm, which attained a high accuracy of 88%, further stamps its utility toward enhancement of academic performance through strong robust techniques of model aggregation. The dataset that was used in this study was sourced from Kaggle, with 1205 entries of 14 attributes concerning adaptability, sentiment, and academic performance; the reliability and richness of the analytical basis are high. The dataset allows rigorous modeling and validation to be done to ensure the findings are considered robust. This study has several implications for education and develops on the key dimensions: teacher effectiveness, educational leadership, and well-being of the students. From the obtained information about student adaptability and sentiment, the developed system helps educators to make modifications in instructional strategy more efficiently for a particular student to enhance effectiveness in teaching.

Based on upper echelons theory, this study hypothesized that GEL has a positive impact on AI-driven GPI, while green technology turbulence (GTT) moderates this relationship. AI-driven GPI acts as a mediator between GEL and firm performance. We tested the research hypotheses using data from 255 Small and Medium Size Enterprises in China's Traditional Chinese Medicine manufacturing industry. The results indicate that GEL positively impacts AI-driven GPI, while GTT negatively moderates this effect. Moreover, AI-driven GPI mediates the GEL - firm performance relationship. This study enhances the understanding of GEL as a unique leadership behavior that encourages innovation, identifies potential opportunities, and takes risks when leveraging AI-driven GPI to improve firm performance. Furthermore, this study addresses the debate on AI's role in environmental sustainability, identifying AI-driven GPI as a strategic pivot for change in governance, values, and culture within firms. The study concludes by providing suggestions for firms to achieve financial and environmental performance in an uncertain technological environment, thereby providing new insights for future research. Based on these findings, policymakers should develop incentives and frameworks to promote AI-driven GPI and incorporate GEL into leadership practices, enhancing firm competitiveness in the Industry 5.0 era and advancing the Sustainable Development Goals.","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39908608/","doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.124438","pmid":"39908608","arxiv_id":null,"year":2025,"journal":null,"authors":["Liu, Y","Ho, TCF","Omar, R","Ning, B"],"categories":[],"published":"2025-01-01","primary_topic":"Entrepreneurship;Artificial Intelligence;Sustainability","secondary_topics":["Green Leadership","Environmental Innovation"],"potential_impact":4}]</results>
